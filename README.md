# Project: Facebook Clone

### What's this

The final capstone project of [The Odin Ruby on Rails Learning Track](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/final-project). The project involves building a facebook clone with some of the core features of the platform – users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking”.
